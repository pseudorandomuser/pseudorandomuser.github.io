I am a Cybersecurity M.Sc. student working part-time as a Student DevOps Engineer at an IT security company.

Over the years, I have gained proficiency in a wide range of programming languages and know my way around a diverse set of frameworks and tools, ranging from Flask for backend API development to Terraform and Ansible for infrastructure provisioning and configutation. Coming from a security background, I enjoy getting to apply my knowledge in diverse areas, be that by automating, hardening and expanding my homelab during my free time, or at work in a cloud infrastructure environment.

Aviation is one of my greatest passions, and I am hoping to be able to pick up flying as either a hobby or a career path in the future.
